# Greedy Algorithms and Invariants

- a greedy algorithm is one such that computes a solutions in steps, where at each step the algorithms makes an unchangeable decision that is locally minimum
- for optimization problems where there is a natural set of choices to select from, greedy algorithms are often the correct choice
- conceptualize greedy algorithms recursively, then implement it iteratively
- consider a greedy algorithm as a way to give insight into the optimum algorith or serve as a heuristic
- the correct greedy algorithm may not be obvious

# Invariants

- consider employing invariants in a algorithm design
- coming up with an invariant can be difficult
    - often, it is a subset of the set of input space
