# Stack

- LIFO
    - last-in first-out
- useful for creating reversed iterators
    - ie singly linked lists
- recognize uses for LIFO property of stack
    - ie parsing
- consider augmenting basic structure to support more operations
    - ie finding max element

## Stack Library

```python3
# list
s.append(e)
s[-1]
s.pop()
len(s) == 0
```

# Queues

- FIFO
    - first-in first-out
- queues are ideal when some notion of order needs to be preserved

## Queue Library

```python3
colletions.deque

q.append(e)
q[0]
q[-1]
q.popleft()
```
